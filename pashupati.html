<b>History of Pashupatinath Temple</b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to mythology, Gods sometimes take disguise of animals, birds or men to retire from their cosmic work and enjoy earth. On one such occasion, Lord Shiva and Lord Parvati visited earth in the form of deer. They reached the forest regions of Nepal and were mesmerized by the beauty of the land. When they reached the banks of River Bagmati, they decided to stay there for eternity. When the other gods and saints decided to bring the couple back to their cosmic work, Lord Shiva rejected the offer. With no other option, Gods decided to use force to bring them back. During this colossal fight, Lord Shiva, in the disguise of a deer, lost one of his antlers. This antler was worshipped as the first lingam of Nepal in Pasupatinath. The lingam is said to be reclaimed by Mother Earth and was lost for several centuries, until one day, Kamadhenu, deity in the form of cow came down to earth, irrigated the soil around the region with her milk and retrieved the lingam. The villagers retrieved the lingam and built a wooden temple. The temple is said to be at the site from 400 AD.<br>

According to an inscription found inside the temple, the wooden temple was thriving during 800 AD and Supusapa Deva king built the five storeys over the temple, again using wood. The temple was rebuilt in 5th century. In 13th century, Ananta Malla King added the artistic details to the temple. Later, it was destroyed by passage of time and termites. In 17th century, the current structure was rebuilt with 492 temples along with the main temple.
