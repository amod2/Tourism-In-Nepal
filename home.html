After the success of Visit Nepal Year 1998 and Nepal Tourism Year 2011, the Tourism Board of Nepal introduced Visit Nepal Campaign 2020. The Campaign was announced in 2015 to be held in 2018 but was later postponed to 2020. <br><br>

   
The mainstream media publicized Nepal as utterly devastated by the earthquake in 2015 and failed to show that Kathmandu with other major cities was almost intact. The earthquake significantly affected the inflow of tourists in 2016 as the number of tourists halved compared with previous year.

The year 2017 saw the inflow of tourists bounce back to the pre-earthquake numbers. The year 2017 saw 940,218 foreigners enter the country. Some came for recreational activities while some visited to support the people of affected areas and with the motive to help the country economically by visiting Nepal.

The Visit Nepal 2020 campaign was scheduled in 2018 to promote that Nepal was a safe place to travel and only 12 of 75 districts were affected by the earthquake. The crawling upgrading activity of Tribhuwan International Airport and delayed construction of Gautam Buddha International Airport in Lumbini and improper transportation infrastructure led the Tourism Board to postpone the campaign to 2020.<br><br>

One of the reasons to visit Nepal is for trekking and climbing mountains. You can climb to the top of the World by scaling and conquering the Everest, the highest peak in the World. Trekking comes with viewing the natural beauty of Himalayas and knowing the lifestyle of people living in altitudes above 4000 meters.  <br><br>

The objective of tourism campaign is to promote Nepal as a tourism destination and to improve the economic situation of the country.  <br><br>

<b><font size=5px>IS NEPAL SAFE TO TRAVEL AFTER 2015 EARTHQUAKE</font></b><br><br>
The earthquake of April 25, 2015, killed 8686 people leaving thousands injured and many more homeless. The rural parts of Nepal are still recovering from the damage caused by the incident. The resulting year saw tourists number all-time low in preceding six years. The Visit Nepal 2020 campaign can be the backbone to support the fragile economic conditions of numerous families in the rural areas.<br><br>

Some media outlets reports of Nepal in the state of complete devastation and buried under heaps of pile is wrong. The earthquake mostly downed old buildings made of mud and some temples around the affected districts. The majority of Kathmandu remains intact which was not shown in the media, all a scheme to generate more TRP.<br><br>

Nepal was affected majorly in about 5 districts and minorly in 7 other districts. All other destinations are entirely untouched. The repair and reconstruction of temples and heritage sites are underway and will finish come 2020.<br><br>

Nepal, It’s People, Culture and the Beautiful Paradise Still Lives<br><br>
